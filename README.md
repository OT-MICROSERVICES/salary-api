Salary API is a Java based microservice which is responsible for all the salary related transactions and records in **[OT-Microservices](https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES)** stack. The application is platform independent and can be run on multiple operating system. **[Java Runtime](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)** would be required to run this application.

Supported features of the Salary API are:-

- Spring boot based web framework, which uses tomcat as webserver.
- ScyllaDB is used as primary database for storing all the salary data.
- Redis as cache manager to store the cache response.
- Prometheus and Open-telemetry metrics support for monitoring and observability
- Swagger integration for the API documentation of endpoints and payloads.
- Database migration using the tool called **[migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)**.

## Pre-Requisites

The Salary API application have some database, cache manager and package dependencies. Some of the dependencies are optional and some are mandatory. To compile the application, we only need `maven` as build tool, but for running the application following things are required:-

- **[ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/)**
- **[Redis](https://redis.io/)**
- **[Migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)**
- **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)**

Maven will be used as package manager to download specific version of dependencies to run the Salary API.

## Architecture

## Application

For building the Salary API application, we can use `make` commands with our **[Makefile](./Makefile)**. But first, we need to install the dependencies which can be simply done using the `make` command.

```shell
make build
```

For building the docker image artifact of the attendance api, we can invoke another make command.

```shell
make docker-build
make docker-push
```

Also, Salary API contains different test cases and code quality related integrations. To check the code quality, we can use `checkstyle` plugin with maven. Also, for code coverage and unit testing, we are using Jacoco, and Junit respectively.

```shell
make fmt
make test
```

```shell
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
# For unit testing and code coverage
mvn test
```

The test cases are present in **[src/test/java/com/opstree/microservice/salary](./src/test/java/com/opstree/microservice/salary)**. For dev testing, the Swagger UI can be used for sample payload generation and requests. The swagger page will be accessible on http://localhost:8080/salary-documentation.

Before running the application, we have to make sure our mandatory database (ScyllaDB and Redis) is up and running. Configuration properties will be configured inside **[application.yml](./src/main/resources/application.yml)** file. Also, once the property file is defined and configured properly, we need to run migrations to create database, schema etc. The connection details for migration is available in **[migration.json](./migration.json)**.

```shell
make run-migrations
```

Once the schema, table and database is configured, we can start our application using java runtime.

```shell
java -jar target/salary-0.1.0-RELEASE.jar
```
